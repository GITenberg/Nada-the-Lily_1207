description: "Nada the Lily is an historical novel by English writer H. Rider Haggard,\
  \ published in 1892. It is said to be inspired by Haggard's time in South Africa\
  \ (1875â€“1882). It was illustrated by Charles H. M. Kerr.\nThe novel tells the tale\
  \ of the origin and early life of the hero Umslopogaas, the illegitimate son of\
  \ the great Zulu king and general Chaka, and his love for \"the most beautiful of\
  \ Zulu women\", Nada the Lily. 'Chaka was a real king of the Zulus but Umslopogaas\
  \ was invented by Haggard. He first appeared as an elderly but vigorous warrior\
  \ in Allan Quatermain (1887). He also appears in the novel She and Allan(1921).\n\
  'Nada the Lily' is unusual for a Victorian novel in that its entire cast of characters\
  \ is South African and black.\nThere is some anecdotal evidence that Umslopogaas\
  \ might have been based on an actual person, although not as described in the book.\
  \ He would have been a Swazi not a Zulu.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
